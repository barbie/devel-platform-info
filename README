NAME
       Devel::Platform::Info - Unified framework for obtaining common platform
       metadata

SYNOPSIS
         use Devel::Platform::Info;
         my $info = Devel::Platform::Info->new();
         my $data = $info->get_info();

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a wrapper to the drivers which can determine platform
       metadata regarding the currently running operating system.

       The intention of this distribution is to provide key identifying compo-
       nents regarding the platform currently being used, for the CPAN Testers
       test reports. Currently the reports do not often contain enough infor-
       mation to help authors understand specific failures, where the platform
       may be a factor.

       However, it is hoped that this distribution will find more uses far
       beyond the usage for CPAN Testers.

INTERFACE
       The Constructor


       * new
           Simply constructs the object.

       Methods


       * get_info
           Returns a hash reference to the platform metadata.

           Returns at least the following keys:

             source
             archname
             osname
             osvers
             oslabel
             is32bit
             is64bit
             osflag

           Note that the 'source' key returns the commands and output used to
           obtain the metadata for possible future use.

           Further keys may be available to provide additional information if
           applicable to the specific operating system.
